Nature is the beautiful world around us. It includes everything outside, like trees, mountains, rivers, and animals. There are many different types of nature, from the green forests to the hot deserts and the deep oceans. Nature is home to many animals and plants, and they all work together to keep things in balance. Birds sing in the sky, animals like deer and rabbits live on the ground, and fish swim in the water. It's like a big puzzle, and every piece is important. Nature also changes throughout the year. In spring, flowers bloom, and in fall, leaves turn colorful. Nature gives us food to eat, like fruits and vegetables, and it's a peaceful place where we can relax and enjoy the outdoors. But we have to be careful with nature because sometimes people harm it. We need to take care of nature so it can stay beautiful and healthy for us and for the future.
